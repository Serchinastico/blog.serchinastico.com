Hello everyone!

Today I wanted to make a public announcement — or as public as this blog allows me. Today I'm launching **Antropia, a new software development studio** focused on the first steps of your projects. This is the culmination of years of self-understanding and hard work.

Silly grammatical note: For the remainder of the post I'll use the plural to refer to the studio (we) even though it's only me in it.

# What is Antropia?

We live in the intersection of **product, design and technology** to build fantastic **multiplatform apps**.

When a new project is born, it has multiple needs to make it all flow. It usually involves more than building a great app, it also means creating a landing page, building a coherent visual language, or testing quick ideas to decide the priorities. We love the hectic rumbling of building new things with you, and we believe this is where our generalist skills truly shine. We fill in the gaps in the first phases of your ideas to help you materialize them. This is who we are:

- **Experts in multiplatform mobile apps** - We know the drill, we have been building mobile apps for 8 years and have published countless apps in the stores. We also build prototypes to test ideas quickly you can share with your team. We use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Expo](https://expo.dev/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- **Tech savants** - We have done our fair share of web and backend development, these technologies hold no secrets for us. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/) or the good old **HTML + CSS + JS**, you name it. We build everything you need to support your product launch: APIs, landing and subscription page, blog, public project board, etc.
- **Product oriented** - We are engineers by training, but we haven't grown in isolation. We have learned from the best design and product people. We know the language, we know the tools, and we share the goal. We design with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and we use [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), and [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) for our day-to-day planning and communication.

## The offer

At Antropia, we understand that early-stage projects need clarity, speed, and focus. Here’s what you can expect from working with us:

- **Fixed rate** - We believe in fairness with every and each of our clients. We offer a **fixed rate of $125/hr**[^1]. If the rate changes (due to external factors, like inflation), it will be for all of our clients equally.
- **Focused work** - We work a maximum of **6 hours a day, 5 days a week**. This might sound odd, but this is the only way to ensure you get the most value from our time. We are focused, and we are continuously looking for ways to increase and enhance our time _in the zone_.
- **Working hours** - We work from Spain, but we can adapt our schedule to your timezone, as long as there is a **2-hour overlap** in the range **10AM-6PM CET/CEST**.

## The projects

We specialize in short, focused projects that bring your early-stage ideas to life. Whether it’s validating a concept, building a prototype, or crafting the core of your product, we thrive in the fast-paced, dynamic world of starting something new. Here’s what makes the projects we take on unique:

- **1-month projects** - We are here to help you validate your ideas and to see you grow. We provide everything necessary for you to continue your adventure once your project launches. To make sure this happens within a reasonable timeline, and we don't turn things needlessly long, we only to commit to short projects.
- **Highly collaborative** - Newborn projects are all about the problem, and it's in solving things together that true collaboration emerges. We want to be part of the process. The wider our perspective, the better our decisions. That's why we love having a voice and integrating with your team.
- **Ready to launch** - We want to make sure your idea is validated. We know the rush of creating something new, the pivots, the constant guessing and the never-ending flow of changes. We want to make sure the process ends in something usable, something you can be proud of.

## The process

Working with Antropia is designed to be straightforward, collaborative, and efficient. We follow a clear process that ensures your idea is developed into a tangible product, all while maintaining constant communication and flexibility. Here’s how we make it happen:

1. **Contact** - Email us or fill in the contact form in [antropia.studio](https://antropia.studio/contact). Feel free to include as much information of your project as possible, preferred working hours, goals, etc.
2. **Talk** - Once we've seen we are fit for your project, we schedule a short call to clear up any doubts we may have, talk about schedules, etc. 
3. **Work** - This is where the fun part begins where we bring your idea to life. That includes regular updates, testing versions and our fully-fledged experience at your disposal. The working phase is fully auditable: you own the code repository, the distribution accounts and everything in between.
4. **Closing** - This is the time we spend to release your app in the stores, or explore potential futures for your idea with you, 

# Why "Antropia"?

Explain the name, explain the design and how those two play together to communicate the same message

# What is our focus

Explain the purpose of the studio:
- externally: to help people wanting to see their ideas turn into reality while giving them full control of their projects
- internally: to learn about sane working practices (should I include it here?)

# Who is Antropia?

Talk about my experience to give the project credibility
