My personal blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Development

Install Hugo by following the [official installation steps](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#prerequisites).

### Local development

Run `hugo server` to use Hugo to process all new content and hot reload your local page.

### Production build

Run `hugo` to process all files and place them in the `public` directory. Github pages automatically takes the contents from there.
