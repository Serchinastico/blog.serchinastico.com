# blog.serchinastico.com

My personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Development

This project works with `node` and `npm`. Follow the [official docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install both.

### Local development

Run `npm run dev` to compile the page and serve it locally. Astro will automatically reload on code/content changes.

### Production build

Run `npm run build` to compile all files and place them in the `dist` directory. Github pages will automatically take the contents of the blog from there.
