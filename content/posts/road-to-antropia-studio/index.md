**TL;DR**: In my pursue of the perfect job I created a Software Development Studio focused on prototyping mobile apps.

# Epigraph

I want to start this post by acknowledging this is not my classic tech-ish post where I talk about a problem I solve and the key takeaways of the project. **This post is personal, it's raw, and is definitely not techy**.

This post is all about how I envision my perfect job, my vision on the future of work in the tech industry and how I want to contribute to see this future change.

**Disclaimer #1**: This post is a reflection of my own experiences and thoughts, I reserve the right to change of opinion anytime I want.

**Disclaimer #2**: There are some strong, probably upsetting, opinions in here that can touch a nerve depending on your background and personal history. I'm aware this post will probably hurt my credibility and my project in some way, but I'm willing to step up. If you feel angry at some of the points I present in this post, I recommend reading [this comic](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe) first on the topic of beliefs. 

# A journey of exploration

I've been working for tech startups and agencies for the last 12-ish years. 

My last job was at [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) where I worked as a Security Engineer for 2 years. Yeah, Security, it doesn't sound much like me, and in retrospect, I think picking a Security role was my unconscious way of surfacing my discomfort at the time, somehow. I left Harvest tired, angry and confused. My main issue - and the reason I spent countless hours struggling with the most basic tasks - was that I was no longer able to feel anything but dread for my job. They call it **burnout**, I now prefer the term **alienation**.

I didn't see it at the time, but I now know this period of time has been as crucial as it was painful. It led me to ask myself some of the most important questions, specially around work and life. This post is about the former, and I will leave the latter for a future writeup, if ever.

# *"What is work?"*

During that time, and still today, I started asking myself questions revolving work and all its surrounding topics like salary, working hours, work-life balance, ownership, etc. I condensed here the type of thoughts and questions I asked myself. At first, these were general blurry questions, but eventually more sophisticated ones arised:

- What is work?
- What is meaningful work?
- What motivates work?
- What are the intrinsical motivators (e.g. satisfaction, pride, learning, etc) and extrinsical motivators (e.g. validation, salary, promotions, etc). Which ones work and which ones doesn't? Why?
- What is risk?
- How is work compensated? How is risk compensated? Is it fair?
- How are shares distributed? Why always so unevenly?
- Why are some motivators kept private (i.e. salary) while others are openly talked about? Why are we only *allowed* talk about the ones that makes us look like better employees? - Not that it's forbidden but that is not well looked upon.
- What is truly urgent in a tech job? Is there synthetic urgency?
- Why do we work the amount of time we work? Why 8 hours a day and 5 days a week? Why a fixed amount of annual vacations?
- Why do we keep working long hours even when we know it backfires?
- Why are different types of work (e.g. technical, managerial, tactical, strategic, etc) differently compensated? Does it have to do with employee replacement cost?
- Why do we keep splitting and silo'ing work? KPIs/OKRs ⇒ teams ⇒ projects ⇒ sprints ⇒ tasks; each with their own owners.
- Why is work structured in such a way? Are there better/more organic ways to do it?

And more... I can't even start to describe you how deep the rabbit hole was (and still is). To make it worse, every time I opened a new door all I got back were more questions. Some of these questions might seem ill if you never faced them before, they sure sounded childish to me the first time I heard them out loud. If anyone asked me about working hours 3 years ago I'd just say: ***It's how the world works***.

But this would also be my answer for the many things I take for granted to this day. I realize now how powerful my day to day inertia is, and how that eventually **turned me into a (life) spectator rather than a (life) actor**. Breaking that loop - and truly asking yourself things you haven't asked yourself in a very long time, if ever - is where I found meaning, with its pains and its joys.

I recommend taking a pause here, read some of these questions out loud and think about them, rely on [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle), let the automatic answers come and go, and then explore their true depth.

# Where am I now?

Dear reader, I'm afraid to disappoint you: I still have no definite answers to the previous list of questions, even less for the ones I didn't write down here. Such is life. As of today, I don't even think there is a universal answer, and I tend to think of it as a living explanation that changes with time, experiences and proper reasoning.

While *deconstructing work* (bear with me, that's what I called it), I did my fair share of freelance jobs, developing mobile apps, and exploring how I could make a living in a way that gave meaning to all of this. I discovered a bunch of simple principles that suit me well and are worth pursuing:

- **Novelty**: We usually need a breath of fresh air from time to time, face new challenges, learn concepts, etc. Novelty is a powerful engine, it puts us in motion and, in my case, it's perhaps my main motivator. To keep this going, I need to work on **short projects**.
- **Pride**: I want to feel proud of my work, and the only way to achieve that is if I feel fully responsible for it. In my career, I led projects like implementing SSO or securing emails but they are a "*small*" piece of the whole thing. I need to work on **wide projects**, and feel accountable for them.
- **Progress**: Solving the same problems over and over again ends up being unfun. Even when the domain changes, I always end up implementing a sign up page, a place to store data, notifications and i18n; to name a few. The automation required to make these things easier on each iteration is a challenge I particularly love. **Tooling** makes me feel things are improving with each project, that I learned something new and applied it.
- **Fairness**: The physical benefit of your work is money in one or more of its many forms. I have grown distrustful of compensation mechanics in tech jobs. Some (not all) of the concerns I have are:
  - Bonuses soon turns into politic games.
  - Shares are often used as a carrot on a stick to either keep employees in golden handcuffs if the company is public, or as a promise of a rich future otherwise.
  - Salary is sometimes adjusted to your location - effectively detaching it from your productivity/impact.
  - Different roles have substantially different salaries, even when those roles are equally important for the outcomes of the company.

  There has to be better ways to pay for our work, one that aligns with our results, and reflects our efforts. Also, one that doesn't forcefully create classes.
- **Impact**: I came to realise most of the work I do has little impact in today's world. I want to change this. I can't always decide the kind of projects I take to walk towards this goal (specially at the beginning). What I've done is signing the [Giving What We Can pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge). No matter the project I tackle, I know each one of them will help others in need.
- **Organicity**: I truly believe there are as many roles as persons are in this world. Someone might tag me as *just* a software developer but I see myself as much more. It took me ages to embrace my generalist skills and now I finally feel comfortable enough to safely explore other domains like design, product, security or marketing (also carpentry, artistry or writing, to name a few). From my experience, the best teams are those that work under this proposal, and are filled with **curious, multi-skilled individuals**, better yet when they are **purposefully small**.

# What is Antropia Studio

**Antropia is a cooperative software studio** that embodies these principles, and it's much more. It's my personal commitment to these values, and, while I'm the only member, it's my alter ego: the best mechanism I found to openly talk about different ways of working and discussing alternative views on work organization. There is a translation of forementioned principles into Antropia:

- **Novelty**: Antropia focuses on the initial steps of your projects. We create mobile apps and functional prototypes. Do you need to show your idea to investors? Maybe you just need to kickoff your project while you hire an in-house team. There is only one hard requirement: **projects can't last longer than 1 month**.
- **Pride**: We do mobile apps, but we can also do web, backend, and design. We thrive when we have the full picture, and the best way to do this is by picking **entire projects**, rather than features. Extra points if there are multiple parts involved. We believe when these requirements are met something magical follows: **true collaboration**.
- **Progress**: We work in our own tooling that eases and solves the problems we encounter. While others look for continuous integration and deployment, we look for continuous improvement. Needless to say, it only makes sense for the **tooling** we develop to be **open-source**.
- **Fairness**: There are two ways to look at this: externally and internally. Externally, the only way to be fair is to be transparent: we work on a fixed rate for all clients, no bargaining. Internal fairness, is probably the policy that will take longer to be developed, if only because it's just me, for now. One thing is clear: it'll be up to all shareholders to decide what'll be the best compensation for our own work.
- **Impact**: Because I joined [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), Antropia has joined it as well. That means 10% of our income will be donated to the organisations that can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others. On top of that, when - or if - there are conflicting schedules for projects, we will favor those that better aligns with our principles.
- **Organicity**: Talk about cooperative and evolutionary principles


# Why a cooperative?

Talk about being only one, growing with a cooperative mindset, consent vs consensus and more.
